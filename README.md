## About CogPO

The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology (CogPO) is one of several linked ontologies, knowledge engineering, and information integration efforts that work together to reason about the relationship between the structure and function of the brain. CogPO is a framework for the formal representation of the cognitive paradigms used in behavioral experiments, driven by cognitive neuroscience and neuroimaging examples.

See [the repository wiki](https://github.com/NBCLab/cogpo/wiki) for descriptions of the elements in the ontology.
